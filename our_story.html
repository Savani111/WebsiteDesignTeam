            <h1>Our Band</h1>
            <p>Stage Fright was formed in the late 2010s when guitarist Alex Donovan and drummer Sam Carter bonded over
                their love for progressive and experimental rock at a local music venue. Inspired by bands like Pink Floyd and 
                early Radiohead, they began crafting ambient, rhythmically complex instrumental tracks at a local library's 
                media studio. Soon, bassist Clara Woods and keyboardist Lucas Hayes joined, enriching their sound and completing the lineup.

                The band's name reflects their shared vulnerability, a theme they confront through music. To emphasize this, they wear masks 
                during performances, encouraging audiences to focus solely on the music's emotional depth and innovative sound rather than 
                the performersâ€™ identities. 
                
                Known for blending cinematic soundscapes with introspective lyrics, Stage Fright quickly gained a following with their 
                boundary-pushing approach to rock. Their music continues to evolve, offering a unique fusion of storytelling and sonic 
                experimentation that challenges the limits of the genre.
