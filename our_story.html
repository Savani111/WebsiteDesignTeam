            <h1>Our Band</h1>
            <p>Stage Fright was formed in the late 2010s when guitarist Alex Donovan and drummer Sam Carter bonded over <br/>
                their love for progressive and experimental rock at a local music venue. Inspired by bands like Pink <br/>
                Floyd and early Radiohead, they began crafting ambient, rhythmically complex instrumental tracks at a <br/>
                local library's media studio. Soon, bassist Clara Woods and keyboardist Lucas Hayes joined, enriching <br/>
                their sound and completing the lineup. </p>

              <p>  The band's name reflects their shared vulnerability, a theme they confront through music. To emphasize <br/>
                this, they wear masks during performances, encouraging audiences to focus solely on the music's <br/>
                emotional depth and innovative sound rather than the performersâ€™ identities. </p>
                
              <p>  Known for blending cinematic soundscapes with introspective lyrics, Stage Fright quickly gained a <br/>
                following with their boundary-pushing approach to rock. Their music continues to evolve, offering <br/>
                a unique fusion of storytelling and sonic  experimentation that challenges the limits of the genre. </p>
