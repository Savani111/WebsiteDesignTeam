            <h1>Our Band</h1>
            <p>Stage Fright was formed in the late 2010s when guitarist Alex Donovan and drummer Sam Carter bonded over 
                their love for progressive and experimental rock at a local music venue. Inspired by bands like Pink 
                Floyd and early Radiohead, they began crafting ambient, rhythmically complex instrumental tracks at a 
                local library's media studio. Soon, bassist Clara Woods and keyboardist Lucas Hayes joined, enriching 
                their sound and completing the lineup.</p>

            <p>The band's name reflects their shared vulnerability, a theme they confront through music. To emphasize 
                this, they wear masks during performances, encouraging audiences to focus solely on the music's 
                emotional depth and innovative sound rather than the performers’ identities.</p>
                
            <p>Known for blending cinematic soundscapes with introspective lyrics, Stage Fright quickly gained a 
                following with their boundary-pushing approach to rock. Their music continues to evolve, offering 
                a unique fusion of storytelling and sonic experimentation that challenges the limits of the genre.</p>
